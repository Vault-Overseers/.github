Welcome to the Vault-Overseers Github organisation. This is the official organisation for the Nuclear-14 fork of Space Station 14.

WE ARE IN NO WAY AFFILIATED WITH BETHESDA SOFTWORKS, MICROSOFT CORPORATION or any other company.

Nuclear-14 is not a trademark or commercial product and is comprised of fan made content, adapting the lore from the Fallout franchise into a total conversion "mod" for Space Station 14.
